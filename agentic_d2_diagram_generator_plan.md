# Agentic D2 Diagram Generator - Comprehensive Plan

## Project Overview

An agentic application that automatically generates D2 diagrams from code files or repositories with built-in reflection and evaluation capabilities to ensure high-quality, renderable output.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Multi-Agent System Design

#### Agent Roles:
- **Code Analysis Agent**: Parses and understands code structure
- **Diagram Design Agent**: Decides optimal diagram types and layouts
- **D2 Generation Agent**: Creates D2 syntax from analyzed code
- **Reflection Agent**: Validates D2 syntax and renderability
- **Evaluation Agent**: Assesses diagram quality and readability
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates workflow and handles retries

#### Agent Communication:
- Message-based communication with structured data
- Shared context store for intermediate results
- Error propagation and recovery mechanisms

### 2. Workflow Pipeline

```
Input (Code/Repo) → Code Analysis → Diagram Design → D2 Generation → Reflection → Evaluation → Output
                     ↓               ↓               ↓           ↓          ↓
                Retry Logic    Layout Strategy  D2 Syntax    Validation  Quality Check
```

## Detailed Component Design

### Phase 1: Code Analysis Agent

**Responsibilities:**
- Parse code files (support multiple languages)
- Extract structural information (classes, functions, relationships)
- Identify dependencies and imports
- Build abstract syntax tree (AST) representations
- Detect design patterns and architectural elements

**Input Processing:**
- Single file analysis
- Repository scanning and indexing
- Language-specific parsers (Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.)
- Configuration file handling (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)

**Output Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "language": "python",
    "file_count": 15,
    "complexity_score": 0.7
  },
  "components": [
    {
      "type": "class",
      "name": "UserService",
      "methods": [...],
      "dependencies": [...],
      "relationships": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Phase 2: Diagram Design Agent

**Responsibilities:**
- Analyze code structure to determine optimal diagram types
- Decide on layout strategies (hierarchical, circular, layered)
- Identify key components to include vs. omit
- Plan visual hierarchy and grouping

**Diagram Type Selection:**
- Architecture diagrams for system overviews
- Class diagrams for object-oriented code
- Flow diagrams for procedural code
- Network diagrams for distributed systems
- Sequence diagrams for interaction patterns

**Layout Strategy Logic:**
- Size-based layout (large repos → multiple diagrams)
- Complexity-based grouping
- Relationship-driven positioning
- Interactive vs. static diagram decisions

### Phase 3: D2 Generation Agent

**Responsibilities:**
- Convert analyzed code data into D2 syntax
- Apply D2-specific styling and themes
- Handle edge cases and complex relationships
- Generate clean, maintainable D2 code

**D2 Syntax Generation:**
- Shape selection and styling
- Connection types and arrow directions
- Label and annotation strategies
- Group and container creation
- Layer definition and ordering

**Error Prevention:**
- Syntax validation during generation
- Cycle detection in relationships
- Overflow handling for large diagrams
- Naming conflict resolution

### Phase 4: Reflection Agent

**Responsibilities:**
- Validate D2 syntax correctness
- Test diagram renderability
- Check for common D2 pitfalls
- Ensure generated diagrams are actually usable

**Validation Steps:**
1. **Syntax Check**: Parse D2 code for syntax errors
2. **Render Test**: Attempt to render diagram using D2 engine
3. **Layout Validation**: Check for overlapping elements, unreadable text
4. **Completeness Check**: Ensure all important relationships are represented
5. **Performance Check**: Verify reasonable rendering times

**Recovery Strategies:**
- Automatic syntax fixing
- Layout adjustment suggestions
- Simplification options for complex diagrams
- Fallback to alternative diagram types

### Phase 5: Evaluation Agent

**Responsibilities:**
- Assess diagram quality and readability
- Provide quantitative and qualitative metrics
- Suggest improvements
- Determine if diagram meets quality standards

**Quality Metrics:**
- **Clarity Score**: Readability of labels and structure
- **Completeness Score**: Coverage of important code elements
- **Aesthetic Score**: Visual appeal and organization
- **Accuracy Score**: Correct representation of code structure
- **Usability Score**: Ease of understanding for viewers

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Information density vs. readability balance
- Appropriate level of abstraction
- Consistent styling and notation
- Logical flow and grouping
- Missing or confusing elements

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Technology Stack
- **Core Language**: Python (for rich ecosystem of code analysis tools)
- **Code Parsing**: Tree-sitter, AST modules, language-specific parsers
- **D2 Integration**: D2 CLI tool, Python subprocess management
- **Agent Framework**: Custom lightweight framework or LangChain
- **Configuration**: YAML/JSON for settings and preferences
- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging and monitoring

### Key Libraries and Tools
- **Code Analysis**: `ast`, `tree-sitter`, `jedi`, `rope`
- **Graph Processing**: `networkx`, `graphviz`
- **File Handling**: `pathlib`, `gitpython` for repo operations
- **D2 Integration**: D2 CLI via subprocess

- **Testing**: `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`

### Error Handling and Resilience
- Graceful degradation for unsupported languages
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Fallback diagram strategies
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Debug mode with detailed logging

## Development Phases - Version 1.0 (Python Only)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- Set up project structure and dependencies
